# LANL-Earthquake-Prediction
## 1. Introduction
Forecasting earthquakes is one of the most important problems in Earth science because of their devastating consequences. Current scientific studies related to earthquake forecasting focus on three key points: when the event will occur, where it will occur, and how large it will be. And the reason the earthquake occurs is the rupture of the geological faults but also by the other event such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, the nuclear test, etc.
So if we predict the earthquake before the time this is very helpful for the people and we can save a life of a people.
