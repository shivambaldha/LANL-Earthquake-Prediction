# LANL-Earthquake-Prediction
## 1. Introduction
Forecasting earthquakes is one of the most important problems in Earth science because of their devastating consequences. Current scientific studies related to earthquake forecasting focus on three key points: when the event will occur, where it will occur, and how large it will be. And the reason the earthquake occurs is the rupture of the geological faults but also by the other event such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, the nuclear test, etc.
So if we predict the earthquake before the time this is very helpful for the people and we can save a life of a people.

## 2. Business Problem
The goal of this competition is to use seismic signals to predict the timing of laboratory earthquakes.
Here we have to predict the remaining time before the next laboratory earthquakes based on the seismic data. The remaining time is meant by the remaining time between the current earthquake and the occurrence of the next earthquake.
Since the seismic data is continuous and the real values and our target is also real value, so this is a regression problem.
